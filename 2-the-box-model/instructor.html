    <h2>About Elena</h2>
    <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Elena believes chess isn't about memorizing moves—it's about understanding patterns and thinking clearly. Her
      goal
      is to
      help you see the board the way strong players do, one concept at a time. Too many students get lost in endless
      opening
      theory or tactical puzzles without grasping the fundamental principles that tie everything together. She focuses
      on
      building your intuition and decision-making skills so you can play confidently in any position. When you
      understand
      the
      'why' behind each move, improvement becomes natural and enjoyable.</p>
    <h3>Experience & Credentials</h3>

      <li>3x National Chess Champion</li>
